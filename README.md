        CUSTOMIZE TWRP RECOVERY
------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yeah, that's it. I was thinking about making twrp images for our device with every single color which you can found in this nice thread.
 Yes, I know that we can put the theme in /TWRP/theme/. But, why don't get rid of that annoying folder, make the change permanent, and most of all, share knowledge? 
 That's what I'm going to do by making even easier

step 1:- First you need to Extract Your Twrp Recovery with

               How to extract ?   Search  youtube :-) 
              
               Image kitchen for android (android).    --->>.  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redlee90.imagekitchenforandroid

step 2:- after extacted goto "ramdisk"  ---->>  "twres". 
       
              Delete " images"  file and replace wit any color you want   few colors are available  in this  directory Choose your fav  color   see the screenshots
              
              if you want any new color  inform me  at  "info.hidden4all@gmail.com"  and the color hex code 
               
              
step 3:- after the file replaced  goto  "change_head_color"  folder  Read  the README.md file and watch screen shot 


Thanks ......Enjoy ;-)
